# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ TESTED: Scheduled actions API fully operational. GET returns actions sorted by scheduled_date with creator information. POST successfully creates actions with all fields (title, description, action_type, scheduled_date, time, location, invitees). PUT /complete correctly marks actions as completed with updated timestamp. Authorization properly enforced."

    message: "Phase 2 implementation complete. Added comprehensive media upload functionality including: Backend - MediaFile and Post models, media upload endpoints with file validation (PNG/JPG/GIF/PDF/DOC/PPTX), local storage system, YouTube URL auto-detection. Frontend - Updated UniversalWall with multiple file upload, file previews, media display components for images/documents/YouTube embeds, real API integration. Ready for backend testing to verify file upload, storage, and posts API functionality."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "PHASE 2 BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE: Media upload functionality is 80% working. ✅ WORKING: Media upload API (PNG/JPG/PDF), file serving API, file storage system, YouTube URL detection, database models. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Posts API parameter structure needs fixing - expects mixed JSON/form data but current implementation causes 422 validation errors. All core media functionality is solid, just need to fix posts API parameter handling."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🎉 POSTS API FIXED AND FULLY TESTED! All backend functionality now working perfectly. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: 1) Fixed Posts API with Form data only - tested all scenarios (text-only posts, posts with media, posts with YouTube URLs, combined posts, edge cases), 2) Posts retrieval with proper author info and media file URLs, 3) Complete media workflow (upload → post creation → retrieval → serving), 4) YouTube URL detection for all formats, 5) All 46 backend tests passed. The Posts API parameter structure issue has been resolved - now uses Form data only (content + media_file_ids). Ready for production use."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🎉 FRONTEND TESTING COMPLETE - ALL MEDIA UPLOAD FUNCTIONALITY WORKING! ✅ COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND TESTING: 1) User registration/login flow works, 2) Dashboard access successful after onboarding completion, 3) Post creation form opens correctly ('Что у Вас нового?' placeholder), 4) Image upload button functional with proper file type validation, 5) YouTube URL integration perfect - videos embed correctly with proper ID extraction, 6) Post submission works - posts appear in feed immediately, 7) Media display components working (found 13 posts with various media), 8) Token storage fix verified (using 'zion_token'), 9) All CSS styling functional. CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Token storage inconsistency resolved. The complete media upload workflow is now production-ready!"

    message: "🎉 CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFIED - IMAGE DISPLAY FUNCTIONALITY WORKING! ✅ AUTHENTICATION FIX CONFIRMED: Media serving endpoint GET /api/media/{file_id} now works WITHOUT authentication as intended. Backend logs show successful 200 OK responses for media requests. API testing confirms: 1) Media upload requires auth (POST /api/media/upload - 401 without token), 2) Media serving is public (GET /api/media/{file_id} - 200 OK without token), 3) Posts API working with media attachments, 4) Image URLs correctly formatted as /api/media/{file_id}, 5) Existing posts contain images with proper metadata. ⚠️ UI TESTING LIMITED: Frontend onboarding process prevents full UI workflow testing, but backend functionality and API endpoints are fully verified. The critical authentication fix for image display is CONFIRMED WORKING."

    message: "FIXING MEDIA STORAGE FULL-WIDTH LAYOUT: User reported that media storage needs to fill 100% of content area. Fixed CSS layout issues: 1) Updated .main-content-area.full-width to use flex: 1 !important instead of just width: 100%, 2) Added width: 100% to .media-storage component, 3) Added proper box-shadow styling. App.js correctly applies full-width class when activeView is media-photos/documents/videos. Need testing to verify that media storage now takes full available width when accessed via sidebar navigation."
